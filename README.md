# Premotion AspNet AppHarbor Integration
*Brought to you by [Premotion Software Solutions](http://www.premotion.nl/ "Premotion Software Solutions")*

This module modifies the native System.Web.HttpContext to make ASP.NET agnostic of the [AppHarbor](https://appharbor.com/ "AppHarbor") load balancing setup. You no longer need to worry about port numbers, secure connections and eaten remote IP addresses.

This library fixes the following issues for you automagically:

* [http://support.appharbor.com/kb/getting-started/information-about-our-load-balancer](http://support.appharbor.com/kb/getting-started/information-about-our-load-balancer)

## Configuration
To set up the module properly for both local development and production add the following application setting to your web.config:

	<appSettings>
		<add key="DOCKED_AT_APPHARBOR" value="false" />
	</appSettings>

Then on the AppHarbor create an configuration variable with the key DOCKED\_AT\_APPHARBOR with value set to 'true'. See [Managing environments](http://support.appharbor.com/kb/getting-started/managing-environments "Managing environments") pages for more detail.
